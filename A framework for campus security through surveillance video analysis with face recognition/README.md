University campuses, like SRM University-AP, are busy places with a constant flow of people entering and exiting the campus. However, with such a large arriving of individuals, there is always a risk of unauthorized entry by individuals with fake identification cards or through the help of accomplices. Manual verification of each entry can be a difficult and time-consuming task, especially considering the vast area of the campus. As a result, there is a need for an efficient and secure solution to enhance campus security.
One promising technology that can address this issue is face recognition. Face recognition technology has gained significant attention in recent years due to its ability to provide reliable and non-intrusive identification of individuals based on their facial features. In this research paper, we propose a framework that utilizes face recognition technology to enhance campus security by preventing unauthorized entry.
The proposed framework involves the registration of faces of students and faculty at the time of joining the university. Later, the video streams from the surveillance cameras installed across the campus are analyzed using face recognition algorithms. Any unrecognized faces captured by the surveillance cameras are flagged by the proposed system, allowing security personnel who manually monitor the surveillance feeds to easily locate and identify potential unauthorized individuals. These suspicious individuals can then be carefully crosschecked by the security personnel to ensure the safety of all students and staff on campus.
The main objective of this research work is to design and implement an efficient face recognition system that can enhance campus security by reducing the need for manual verification and improving the accuracy of identifying unauthorized individuals. The proposed system has the potential to not only streamline security measures but also minimize the workforce required for manual verification, making it a cost-effective solution for campus security.
In the following sections of this paper, we will present the design and implementation details of the proposed face recognition system, including the methodology used for face registration, the algorithms employed for face recognition, and the overall system architecture. We will also discuss the potential benefits and implications of the proposed system for university campuses in terms of enhanced security and reduced workload for security personnel.

Conclusion:

The proposed framework for securing a university campus from unauthorized entry using face recognition technology has the potential to be an effective and efficient solution for enhancing campus security. Further research and implementation of the system can lead to improved security measures and better protection for university campuses and their communities.
